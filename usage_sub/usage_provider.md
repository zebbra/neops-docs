# Providers

Providers act as a template for tasks. They provide functionality and expose configuration parameters through JSON Forms to the user. 

This way, a provider can be written (like a function) in a generic and reusable way, while a task contains configuration which are passed to the provider.

Neops comes with a set of providers out of the box, see [bult in providers](https://link)
